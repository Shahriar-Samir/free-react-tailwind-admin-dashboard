- Then you have to clone the client-side repo of this project and just like before clone it in that directory where the client repo has been cloned.
- After finishing all repos clone to the project directory and open the terminal.
- In your both client and server terminals write 'npm i' for installing dependencies.
- At last, give the command 'npm start' to the server side integrated terminal. 
- Then you have to give the command 'npm run dev' in the client side terminal and go to the link 'http://localhost:5173', now you should see this web project running on your local machine.
